# What Are Frameworks and Libraries?

Frameworks and libraries are pre-written collections of code that help developers streamline their development process and solve common programming tasks. While they serve similar purposes, they differ significantly in scope and approach:

## Frameworks

- **Definition:** Frameworks provide a structured environment and predefined architecture for building applications.
- **Usage:** They enforce specific design patterns and workflows, requiring developers to work within their constraints using built-in components, libraries, and APIs.
- **Features:** Frameworks typically offer tools for database access, user authentication, routing, and more.
- **Key Attribute:** "Inversion of control" â€“ the framework calls your code instead of you calling the framework.

## Libraries

- **Definition:** Libraries are reusable collections of functions, classes, or modules designed to perform specific tasks.
- **Usage:** Developers can integrate libraries into their projects as needed, retaining complete control over application structure.
- **Features:** Libraries often focus on specific functionalities, such as data manipulation, network communication, or image processing.
- **Key Attribute:** Developers call the library functions directly in their code.

## Summary

Frameworks dictate the overall application structure and provide a comprehensive environment, while libraries offer granular, task-specific functionality with greater flexibility. By using these frameworks and libraries, C developers can tackle various tasks more efficiently while maintaining code reliability and performance.
