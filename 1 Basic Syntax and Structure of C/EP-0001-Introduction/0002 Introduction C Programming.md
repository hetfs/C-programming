## **Introduction to C**

C is a general-purpose programming language developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. Known for its **efficiency**, **flexibility**, and **portability**, C provides low-level access to system resources, making it ideal for tasks that require close interaction with hardware. Despite being over 50 years old, C remains a cornerstone of modern programming and has influenced the design of many popular languages, including **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**.

## **Origins and Development**

C was born out of the need for a versatile programming language capable of developing the **Unix operating system**. Dennis Ritchie built on concepts from earlier languages like **B** and **BCPL** to create C, introducing features such as **strong typing**, **structured programming**, and **efficient memory management**. This innovation allowed Unix to be rewritten entirely in C, significantly improving its efficiency and portability.
