# What is Data Structure: Types, Classifications and Applications

Data Structure refers to the organization and storage of data in a computer system. It includes various types and classifications, and is widely used in different applications.

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access, modification, and manipulation. Here are key points about data structures:

1. **Types:** Data structures can be categorized into linear and non-linear types. Linear data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, while non-linear structures include trees and graphs [[3](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/data-structure-types)].

2. **Classifications:** Data structures can also be classified based on their implementation and usage. For example, they can be classified as static or dynamic based on memory allocation, or as primitive or non-primitive based on data type [[4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data-structure-types-classifications-and-applications/)].

3. **Applications:** Data structures find applications across various fields such as software engineering, database management, networking, and machine learning. They are fundamental in designing algorithms and optimizing resource utilization in computer systems [[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data-structure-types-classifications-and-applications/)].
