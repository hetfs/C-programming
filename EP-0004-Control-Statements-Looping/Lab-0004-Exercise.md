## 4 How many keywords are there in C?

There are 32 keywords in the C 98 programming language and 5 was added in C 99.

1. What are the most commonly used keywords in C?
Some of the most commonly used keywords in C include "int", "char", "float", "while", "for", "if", "else", "return", "void", and "switch".

2. What does the keyword "int" do in C?
The keyword "int" is used to declare an integer variable in C.

3. What does the keyword "while" do in C?
The keyword "while" is used to create a loop that continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

4. What is the difference between "for" and "while" loops in C?
The "for" loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand, while the "while" loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand. The "for" loop also has a counter that is incremented with each iteration, while the "while" loop simply continues to execute as long as the condition is true.

5. What is the use of the keyword "if" in C?
The keyword "if" is used to perform conditional statements in C. It allows the program to execute different code blocks based on whether a specified condition is true or false.

6. What does the keyword "void" do in C?
The keyword "void" is used to declare a function in C that does not return a value.

7. What is the use of the keyword "switch" in C?
The keyword "switch" is used to perform multiple branches in C based on the value of a specified variable. It is often used as an alternative to a series of "if-else" statements.

8. Can keywords in C be used as variable names?
No, keywords in C cannot be used as variable names or identifiers. They have a specific meaning and function in the language and cannot be redefined.

9. What is the importance of keywords in C?
Keywords are important in C because they help the compiler understand what the programmer intends to do in the code. By using keywords, the programmer can easily communicate the structure and intent of the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

10. Can new keywords be added to C?
No, new keywords cannot be added to C. The set of keywords in C is fixed and standardized.

11. How do I use keywords in C?
Keywords in C are used as part of the syntax and structure of the language. They have a specific meaning and function, and their usage varies depending on the keyword. It is important to have a good understanding of the keywords and their uses in order to write efficient and effective code in C.
