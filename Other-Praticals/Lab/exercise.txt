1. The three parts of the for loop are:
   a. The initialization expression
   b. The condition expression
   c. The increment/decrement expression

2. The break statement is used to exit from:
   b. A for loop

3. A do-while loop is useful when we want that the statements within the loop must be executed:
   b. At least once

4. In what sequence the initialization, condition, execution is done in the do-while loop:
   b. Initialization, execution, testing

5. Which of the following statements is used to take the control to the beginning of the loop—
   c. continue

6. int i=1;
    for( ; i++ ;)
                        printf(“%d”, i);
   
7. int a=5;
   do
   {
printf(“%d\n”,a);
a = -1;
   }while(a >0);
   
8. What will be the value of sum after the execution of the following program:
   The value of sum will remain 1 because the condition `index > 9` is false from the beginning, so the loop body will not execute, leaving sum unchanged.
