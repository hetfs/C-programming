What is C Programming?
C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It was designed to provide low-level access to memory, making it ideal for system programming, embedded systems, and developing efficient applications. C programming has a simple syntax and a powerful set of features, making it widely used in a range of industries.

Features of C Programming
Modularity: C supports modular programming, allowing developers to break down programs into smaller, manageable modules.
Portability: C programs can be compiled and run on various platforms with minimal modifications.
Efficiency: C provides direct access to memory, enabling efficient memory management and faster execution.
Wide Range of Applications: C is used in operating systems, embedded systems, game development, scientific applications, and more.
Standard Libraries: C comes with a rich set of standard libraries that provide functions for various tasks, such as input/output operations, string manipulation, and mathematical computations.
Now, let’s explore some C programming questions at different difficulty levels:
