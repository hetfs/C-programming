## How to Write Your First Program in C?

To write your first program in C, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Text Editor**: Use any text editor like Notepad, Sublime Text,VSCodium or Visual Studio Code to write your C program.

2. **Write the Code**: Start by writing the C code. A simple "Hello, World!" program is a common choice for beginners.

Here's an example:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       printf("Hello, World!\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

1. **Save the File**: Save your C program with a `.c` extension, such as `hello.c`.

   1. **Compile the Program**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your program is saved, and compile it using a `C` compiler.

   For example, if you're using GCC, run:

   ```c
   gcc hello.c -o hello
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: After compiling successfully, execute the program by typing its name (without the `.c` extension) in the terminal/command prompt:

   ```c
   ./hello
   ```

3. **Observe the Output**: You should see "Hello, World!" printed on the screen, indicating that your program ran successfully.

Now you've written and executed your first program in C!

## How to Write C Code on Visual Studio Code using GCC Compiler

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**: Download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install C/C++ Extension**: Open Visual Studio Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), and search for and install the "C/C++" extension.

3. **Open a C File**: Create a new file (Ctrl+N) and save it with a `.c` extension, for example, `example.c`.

4. **Write Your C Code**: Inside the file, write your C code.

   For example:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       printf("Hello, World!\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

5. **Compile Your Code**: Press Ctrl+Shift+B to open the command palette, type "Tasks: Run Build Task", and press Enter. Then, select "gcc.exe build active file" to compile your code using GCC.

6. **Run Your Program**: After successfully compiling, you'll see the executable file in the same directory. Open a terminal (Ctrl+\`) and run the executable by typing `.\example.exe` (replace `example` with your file name).

7. **View Output**: The output of your C program will be displayed in the terminal.

Now you can write and compile C code on Visual Studio Code using GCC compiler.
