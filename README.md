## 1 Basic Syntax and Structure of C Overview

Learning C programming comprehensively involves progressing from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

Here's a structured outline for learning C programming, building from basic concepts to advanced topics: 

### EP-0001: Introduction
An overview of the C programming language, its history, and applications. This section introduces the development environment and tools necessary for writing and executing C programs.

### EP-0002: Data Types and Variables
C's fundamental data types are explored, including integers, floats, characters, and more. This section covers variable declaration, initialization, and scope, helping students understand how to store and manipulate data.

### EP-0003: Operators and Expressions
Students learn about various operators in C (arithmetic, relational, logical, etc.) and how to construct expressions. This section emphasizes operator precedence and the formation of complex expressions.

### EP-0004: Input-Output Functions
This section covers standard input and output functions in C, such as `printf` and `scanf`. It teaches students how to interact with users and manage data input and output effectively.

### EP-0005: Control Statements - Conditions
Explores decision-making structures in C, including `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements. This section focuses on how to control the flow of a program based on specific conditions.

### EP-0006: Control Statements - Looping
Covers looping mechanisms such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. This section teaches students how to execute code repetitively and efficiently based on specified conditions.

### EP-0007: Functions in C
Introduces the concept of functions, including function declaration, definition, and calling. This section emphasizes the importance of modular programming and code reusability.

### EP-0008: Arrays
Explains the use of arrays for storing multiple values of the same type. This section covers array declaration, initialization, and common operations such as traversal and manipulation.

### EP-0009: Strings in C
Focuses on string handling in C, including string declaration, manipulation functions, and common operations. This section teaches how to work with sequences of characters effectively.

### EP-0010: Pointers
Introduces pointers, including their declaration, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic. This section highlights the significance of pointers in memory management and dynamic data structures.

### EP-0011: Structures
Covers user-defined data types through structures. This section explains how to group different data types into a single unit and access their members.

### EP-0012: File Handling in C
Discusses file operations in C, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files. This section teaches students how to manage data persistence and file I/O.

### EP-0013: Preprocessor Directives
This section explains the role of preprocessor directives in C, such as `#include` and `#define`. It emphasizes how directives can influence code compilation and organization.

### EP-0014: Standard Library in C
This section introduces the C Standard Library and covers commonly used functions and libraries. It provides insight into using built-in functions for various tasks, enhancing programming efficiency.
